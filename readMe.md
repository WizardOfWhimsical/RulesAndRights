### Pizza Ranch Group Chat – Rights & Rules
This project is a simple HTML document outlining basic rights and ground rules for our internal team group chat at Pizza Ranch.

## 📱 Why I Made This
My boss created a group chat to help everyone at our location stay connected. It includes everyone’s phone numbers, and as one of the older members of the team—with a background in tech—I felt it was important to set some clear, respectful boundaries from the beginning.

We have a high turnover rate and a wide mix of people, including younger employees, so laying out a basic code of conduct helps ensure everyone feels safe and respected. These rules aren’t about policing people—they’re about common sense, mutual respect, and protecting privacy.

## 🧠 What This Is
This is just a lightweight, one-page HTML document with a list of expectations and guidelines. It covers things like:

Respecting each other’s privacy (don’t use phone numbers to contact others without permission)

No harassment, hate speech, or bullying

Encouraging positive social interaction without pressuring anyone

A reminder that just because someone doesn’t hang out with you personally doesn’t mean they dislike you

Keeping the chat clean enough for everyone (we have minors too)

I’ll be sharing a link to this document in the group chat, and everyone will be asked to read it and type “agree” to confirm they understand the boundaries.

## 🛠️ Why on GitHub?
I wanted a lightweight, accessible, and transparent way to host the rules—and GitHub was the natural fit. This isn’t some massive tech project. It’s just me applying some structure where structure’s needed. Sometimes the simplest things are the most important
