      <h2>📜 Rights & Rules of the Ranch Chat 🐂</h2>
      <div>
        This is the Ranch Chat. It ain’t perfect, it ain’t corporate. It’s just
        ours. It’s here to build trust,<br />
        share laughs, make plans, and strengthen the crew. So here are the
        simple rules to keep it solid,<br />
        safe, and respectful for everybody.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphFormatting">
      <h2>📜 Privacy & Respect</h2>
      <div>
        💬 “The right words at the right time build bridges. The wrong ones burn
        them.”<br />
        Let’s be the ones who build.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No using someone’s phone number outside this chat without their
          permission.
        </li>
        <li>
          If they didn’t give you their number personally, don’t call or text
          them privately.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphFormatting">
      <h2>💬 Conduct in the Chat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t be hateful, racist, sexist, or belittle people.</li>
        <li>
          We all cuss, but don’t be graphic or disrespectful — know the line.
        </li>
        <li>You can joke and roast — just keep it light, not cruel.</li>
        <li>If someone crosses a line, handle it in private.</li>
        <li>Reprimand in private, praise in public.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphFormatting">
      <h2>🧠 Thoughts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you’re not sure if something’s okay to say… it probably isn’t.
        </li>
        <li>Nobody here is perfect. That’s cool—we’re learning.</li>
        <li>
          This isn’t a group to control anybody. It’s a group to respect
          everybody.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphFormatting">
      <h2>🚫 What the Chat is NOT For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is NOT where you call out of work — you MUST call the store or
          Kelly directly.
        </li>
        <li>This IS where you can offer up shifts or ask for coverage.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphFormatting">
      <h2>🧒 We Got Youth Here</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We’ve got minors in this chat. Keep the vibe PG-13.</li>
        <li>Cussing is okay. Graphic or explicit stuff is not.</li>
        <li>
          This is a crew, not a locker room. Let’s show the younger folks how to
          carry themselves right.
        </li>
        <h3>🧭 Behavior Code</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Light roasting is fine if it’s mutual. But hateful or targeted
            speech = not cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can say, “you’re a dick.” You can’t say, “go suck a dick.” ➤
            There’s a difference, and we all know it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t belittle people’s age, gender, race, religion, or
            background—we’re here to lift, not crush.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphFormatting">
      <h2>🤝 Equal Ground</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No judging based on age, sex, race, religion, or personal views.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don’t vibe with someone, just don’t hang out — no need for
          drama.
        </li>
        <h3>Personal Boundaries</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Light flirting is fine if it’s mutual.</li>
          <li>Dudes: be aware of your tone.</li>
          <li>
            No one should feel unsafe or uncomfortable because of a chat
            message. Period.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphFormatting">
      <h2>🙏 Belief & Expression</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You’re welcome to say “God bless,” “amen,” or “thank you, Jesus” if
          that’s how you feel.
        </li>
        <li>
          But no preaching or political debates—we keep that separate from this
          space.
        </li>
        <li>
          You be you—but don’t try to convert or correct anyone else for being
          themselves.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphFormatting">
      <h2>📝 Strike System?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If someone keeps crossing lines, we’ll figure it out.</li>
        <li>
          Kelly is the manager. Any real enforcement or consequences come down
          to her call.
        </li>
        <li>
          For now: just don’t be a jerk, and we won’t have to deal with strikes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      Just because someone doesn’t want to hang with you doesn’t mean they hate
      you. Respect their space. Don’t take it personal — they’re just protecting
      their peace. Don’t step on someone’s happiness just because you feel left
      out.<br />
      💭 "Strong people build spaces where others feel safe. Wise people know
      when to step back to protect the peace."
